âœ… **What I Learned:**

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Single-line Comments (`//`)

Used to write brief notes or disable one line of code.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let name = "Narayan";  // Inline comment
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Multi-line Comments (`/* ... */`)

Used when you want to explain something in more detail.

```javascript
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span across multiple lines.
Great for explaining code blocks.
*/
let age = 25;
```

### ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Disabling Code for Debugging

```javascript
// console.log("This won't run");
```

---

ðŸ“Œ **Why Comments Matter:**

* Help you (and others) understand your code later
* Make your projects clean and well-documented
* Useful during testing and debugging
